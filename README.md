# Movie-Project
Objective: Using a dataset from Kaggle (scrapped from IMDb), find trends in the movie industry by visualizing the data; apply skills learned from Google Analytics course (asking the right questions, etc) to create meaningful insights about the trends. Kaggle dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies (Version 2)

All the data analysis (data cleaning, data visualization using python, answering questions) has been done in the Movie.ipynb file (using jupyter notebook).

Comment - Line graph using Bokeh sometimes doesn't show up when viewing it on github, so I also included a .png file showing the graph
